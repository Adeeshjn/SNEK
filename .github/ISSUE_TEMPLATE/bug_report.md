# Snake Movement
## Description
The game ends when the snake moving in one direction is made to move in the opposite direction. The snake should not be able to move in the opposite direction at all. Ex - If the snake is moving right and the left arrow is pressed, the game ends because the head touches the body of the snake.
# Bug Replication

2. Press the right arrow button(snake starts moving right)
3. Press the left arrow button(game ends)
